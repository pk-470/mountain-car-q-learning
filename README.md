# Mountain Car Q-learning

This is an application of Q-learning which I did as a part of my AI masters in Maastricht University. The goal is to solve the famous OpenAI gym mountain car problem. For a full problem description look into the "LAB - RL.pdf" file. Run the code from the "mountain_car.py" file in the "Code" folder.
